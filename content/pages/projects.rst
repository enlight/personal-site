I've mostly been writing plugins for `Unreal Engine 4`_ since its official release, instead of using
it to build some games like I ought to.

`klawr`_
  A set of Unreal Engine 4 plugins that enable the use of C# (and other CLI languages) in game
  projects targeting the Windows platform.
  
`ue4-hg-plugin`_
  An Unreal Engine 4 plugin that allows in-editor version control features to work with Mercurial 
  repositories.
  
`Skelly`_
  An Unreal Engine 4 plugin for creating semi-procedural character animations.

Prior to that I was writing a plugin for `Unity 3d`_.

`ubonsai`_
  A simple C# behaviour tree library with a node based custom editor for the Unity game engine.
